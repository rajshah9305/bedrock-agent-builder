### Code Quality
- [ ] No AWS credentials in code
- [ ] No `.env` files in Git repository
- [ ] ESLint passes: `npm run lint`

- [ ] No console errors in development mode

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. GitHub Setup
- [ ] Code pushed to GitHub repository
- [ ] Repository is public or Vercel has access
- [ ] All changes committed
- [ ] `.gitignore` properly configured

### 2. Vercel Project Setup
- [ ] Vercel account created
- [ ] Repository imported to Vercel
- [ ] Framework preset: **Vite** (auto-detected)
- [ ] Build command: `pnpm build` or `npm run build`
- [ ] Output directory: `dist`

### 3. Environment Variables in Vercel

Navigate to: **Project Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables**

#### Required Variables (All Environments):

**Backend Variables (KEEP SECRET!):**
```bash
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
```

**Frontend Variables:**
```bash
VITE_AWS_REGION=us-east-1
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-project.vercel.app/api
```

- [ ] All environment variables added
- [ ] Variables set for: Production ‚úÖ
- [ ] Variables set for: Preview ‚úÖ
- [ ] Variables set for: Development ‚úÖ

### 4. Initial Deployment
- [ ] Click "Deploy" in Vercel
- [ ] Wait for deployment to complete (2-3 minutes)
- [ ] Check deployment logs for errors
- [ ] Deployment successful ‚úÖ

### 5. Post-Deployment Verification

#### Test the Deployment:
- [ ] Visit deployed URL: `https://your-project.vercel.app`
- [ ] Application loads without errors
- [ ] No "Simulated Mode" warning visible
- [ ] Agent creation form appears correctly

#### Test API Endpoints:
```bash
# Test list endpoint
curl https://your-project.vercel.app/api/agents/list

# Test create endpoint
curl -X POST https://your-project.vercel.app/api/agents/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "agentName": "Test Agent",
    "instructions": "Test instructions",
    "foundationModel": "anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0"
  }'
```

- [ ] List endpoint returns 200 status
- [ ] Create endpoint accepts requests
- [ ] No CORS errors in browser console

#### Test Agent Creation:
- [ ] Fill out agent creation form
- [ ] Select a foundation model
- [ ] Add instructions
- [ ] Click "Create Agent"
- [ ] Success toast appears
- [ ] Agent appears in agent list
- [ ] Button shows "(Live)" not "(Simulated)"

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If "Simulated Mode" Still Shows:

1. **Check environment variables:**
   - [ ] Go to Vercel ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   - [ ] Verify `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is correct
   - [ ] Ensure it starts with `https://` not `http://`

2. **Redeploy after adding variables:**
   - [ ] Go to Deployments tab
   - [ ] Click ‚ãØ menu ‚Üí Redeploy
   - [ ] Check "Use existing Build Cache" is OFF

3. **Check browser console:**
   - [ ] Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - [ ] Look for API errors
   - [ ] Verify API calls are going to correct URL

### If API Returns 403/401 Errors:

- [ ] Verify AWS credentials in Vercel are correct
- [ ] Check IAM user has Bedrock permissions
- [ ] Ensure Bedrock is enabled in AWS region
- [ ] Check AWS account has access to models

### If API Returns 404 Errors:

- [ ] Verify API files are in `api/` directory
- [ ] Check file names match exactly (create.js, list.js)
- [ ] Ensure files are committed to Git
- [ ] Redeploy to sync files

## üìä Monitoring Setup
